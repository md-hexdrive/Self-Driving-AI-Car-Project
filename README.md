# Self-Driving AI Car Project
 This is the Code and Documentation for the Self Driving Car for my final Project in COMP 444 Embedded/Robotic Programming at Athabasca University

The programming is all in Python and Jupyter notebooks from [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).
This project is a work in progress and the programming/documentation isn't completed.
