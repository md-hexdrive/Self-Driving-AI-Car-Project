# Self-Driving AI Car Project
 This is the Code and Documentation for the Self Driving Car for my final Project in the COMP 444 Embedded/Robotic Programming course at Athabasca University

The programming is all in Python and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) notebooks.

The programming for training the AI is based on the [DeepPiCar tutorials](https://towardsdatascience.com/deeppicar-part-1-102e03c83f2c), specifically, this [notebook](https://github.com/dctian/DeepPiCar/blob/master/models/lane_navigation/code/end_to_end_lane_navigation.ipynb).
The programming that helped me figure out how to control the car from the Raspberry Pi came from [this tutorial](https://www.bluetin.io/dc-motors/motor-driver-raspberry-pi-tb6612fng/) and the [SparkFun TB6612FNG Hookup Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/tb6612fng-hookup-guide/all).

This project is a work in progress and the programming/documentation isn't complete.

This car can drive completely autonomously along roadways made out of tape or paper.

The car uses a neural network that is trained by watching how a human driver navigates the track and uses the data provided by them to learn how to drive on its own.
